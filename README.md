# Aircall - iOS Technical test

## Summary

Purpose of this test is to show how you develop and structure your code.

To do so, you will build a small Aircall iOS app from scratch.

> While it can be fun to test new frameworks/tools we remember you the objective is to evaluate your skills and reasoning.

### General rules

- Use the architecture you prefer
- Use any library you want
- Use **UIKit or SwiftUI**
- Your app need to be **compatible with iOS n-1**
  - for instance if iOS15 is the latest available version, your app need to support iOS14+

### Things you need to implement

1. Display a ****list of calls**** page
2. Click on call from the list will redirect to ****call details**** page
3. You should be able to ****archive a call**** from List and Details page
    - Archived calls will no longer be visible from ****list of calls****

| List of calls                 |  Call details               |
|-------------------------      |-------------------------    |
| ![](assets/activity_feed.png) | ![](assets/call_detail.png) |

### Where to focus

1. We will pay attention on the architecture of your app
1. We favour simple maintainable code over over-engineering
2. The quality of your tests
3. The clarity and documentation of your code
4. Try to follow the screens design. No need for pixel perfect just match the essence.
